/* Wrong solution: need to be fixed */

Without loss of generality, I can assume that \\(P(1)+S(1) \le P(2)+S(2) \le ... \le P(N)+S(N)\\).

If Farmer John does not have a coupon, this is a well known problem that can be solved with a greedy algorithm. The optimal solution (that maximized the number of selected cows) is obtained by selecting cows from \\(1\\) to \\(N\\) until the budget \\(B\\) runs out. Let the maximum number of cows without using a coupon is denoted by \\(M\\).

Now let us consider the case where Farmer John has a coupon. Since there is only one coupon, the answer will be \\(M\\) or \\(M+1\\) (If the answer is larger than \\(M+1\\), at least two coupon should be used). Using the coupon for cows \\(1\\) to \\(M\\) will not result the answer to be \\(M+1\\) since the amount of discount will be less than \\(P(i)+S(i)\\) for \\(i \gt M\\). Therefore, we increase \\(i\\) from \\(M+1\\) to \\(N\\) and check whether if using the coupon for cow \\(i\\) would result the answer to be \\(M+1\\). If such \\(i\\) does not exist, the answer is \\(M\\).

The code is shown below.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct cost {
	int price;
	int shipping;
	int total;
};

int main()
{
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(NULL);
	cout.tie(NULL);

	int n, b;
	cin >> n >> b;

	vector<cost> request(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
		cin >> request[i].price;
		cin >> request[i].shipping;
		request[i].total = request[i].price + request[i].shipping;
	}

	sort(request.begin(), request.end(), [](cost a, cost b) { return a.total < b.total; });

	int count = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
		if (b - request[i].total < 0)
			break;
		b -= request[i].total;
		++count;
	}

	for (int i = count; i < n; ++i) {
		if (request[i].price / 2 + request[i].shipping <= b) {
			cout << count + 1 << "\n";
			return 0;
		}
	}

	cout << count << "\n";

	return 0;
}
```
