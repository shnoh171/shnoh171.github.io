Problem: <https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/>

Let \\(l(i)\\) denotes the maximum index I can reach by jumping \\(i\\) times. Then this problem can be solved by iteratively computing \\(l(i)\\) until \\(i\\) exceeds the length of a given array.

```c++
int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
    int num_of_jumps = 0;
    int curr = 0;
    int next = nums[0];

    while (curr < nums.size() - 1) {
        int temp = curr;
        for (int i = curr + 1; i <= min(next, (int)nums.size() - 1); ++i) {
            temp = max(temp, i + nums[i]);
        }
        curr = next;
        next = temp;
        ++num_of_jumps;
    }

    return num_of_jumps;
}
```
