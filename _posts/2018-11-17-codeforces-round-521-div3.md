I solved three of the seven questions, and one of them was hacked. So my final standing is 2/7.

This is a very disappointing result for me. I think I could sove up to four problems. My mistakes were:

- I did not read the problem carefully and dive to the problem. I wasted much time due to misunderstanding the question.
- After solving the problem, I did not verify that the code was correct.

My thoughts to the problems up to D are as follows.

### A. Frog Jumping

### B. Disturbed People

### C. Good Array

### D. Cutting Out

### E. Thematic Contest
