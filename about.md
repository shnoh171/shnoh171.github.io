## Soonhyun Noh

![placeholder](/assets/images/profile.png)

System software engineer, with experience working on operating systems (Linux kernel and AUTOSAR), hypervisors (KVM and XenGT), communication middlewares (DDS), deep learning framework (TensorFlow) and Android framework. Currently interested in platform-level support for edge computing and deep learning (both training and inference).
